# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-Project
The game is my initial project, the very first one to practice JS watching an experienced web developer from FreeCodeCamp.com with explanation and great coding skills.
I have uploaded my own images;
Omitted extra html and css features such as "glow" (mouseover) to keep it simple;
Changed the background colors;
